My name is Axel. I live in this beautiful country we call France. I have a Master Degree in Applied Economics with major in Econometrics and Statistics. I am in general interested in solving problems. What I like the most is the heuristic in problem solving.  
I currently work as a Sofware Engineer in a consulting company based in Nantes, West France.   
I intervene as a C#/.NET developer for large companies where I help building robust, resilient and reliable software for various applications. I am at ease using WPF with the MVVM pattern for building desktop softwares (I keep on eye on the new .NET MAUI) ans with ASP.NET MVC and Blazor.
